Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. Git is able to start tracking the files in your repository (after you make a commit). We need to do it for version control.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. It's a place where files from the repository are put in to be collectively eligible for commits.
   It's valuable because it separates what files you want to track together from the files that don't have a logical connection to them.
