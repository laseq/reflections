When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you work from more than one computer.
    When you want to share your code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's better to be in control rather than be controlled.
    Pulls might happen at unexpected times like when you're editing code locally which would
    result in some confusion.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a repository clone done from someone else's area to your own area on GitHub.
    A clone is cloning a repository from GitHub to your local computer.
    A branch is a way of writing some code without affecting e.g. the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If changes have been made on the remote that would conflict with your local branch such as master,
    you could fetch the remote's changes and store it in the local version of the remote, so that you
    can evaluate the difference between your local master and the local remote master, and make the changes
    as you see fit.
